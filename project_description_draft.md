# Project Description Draft

### Motivation
Given recent technological advances, there is now a large wealth of biological data, which can be used to answer new biological questions. Many tools and algorithms have been developed to analyze this data, and in order to evaluate these methods, benchmarking aims to objectively quantify and compare the capabilities of different methods to address certain issues.

### The Purpose of the Dexamethasone Benchmark
The goal of this website is to provide the community with the resources needed for benchmarking. Data for Dexamethasone and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) also known as NR3C1, the transcription factor targeted by Dexamethasone is provided along with code that benchmark methods for gene expression analysis using this data. Users can compare new methods that they created or see the difference between existing methods by using the data and code to see how the different methods perform.
